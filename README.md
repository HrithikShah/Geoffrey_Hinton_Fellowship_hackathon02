An e-commerce company wants to recommend products to its users. The company has collected only transaction data in the past. The training dataset has only 3 columns - user_id, Product bought and Order value of the product. Using this dataset, predict for all the users in the training dataset, the top 3 categories that the user might buy from.
Training dataset sample

aov = Order Value of the product
category = Product Category where the purchase was made

What do you need to predict?
For each user, predict the top 3 probable product categories that they may purchase from, in the future.
